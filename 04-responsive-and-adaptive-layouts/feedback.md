Good job! Well done! Appreciate your struggles!

good things:
1) Excellent, appropriate and clear style of html and css,
2) Trying to do BEM!
3) Icon fonts, em where it was needed;
4) Mobile first;

flaws and my recommendations:
1) Some problems with social icons on resize from 320px to 600px;
2) Try to avoid use tag <img> for purposes as were in the task. Instead use background-image, especially for avatars.
Would you imagine what happens if you set fixed sizes for avatar image and user loads avatar image with another
aspect-ratio?;
4) Some semantic problems:
- always use title attribute for links;
- logo in most cases should be also a link;
5) As user I prefer that all links would be a blocks (if it inside list, whole <li> should be clickable like you made
with social icons, more over on mobile resolutions);
