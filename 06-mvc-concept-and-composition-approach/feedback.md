Task: MVC
===============================
\+ Done well.

Task: Composition approach
===============================
\+ You use composition to create Car, Boat it's good.
\- But you also used _constructor_ and _new_ keyword - it's bad practice.
If you creating objects with _new_ use it's full functionality - don't return object from constructor.
