I have created nev .css file, because we should make separated file for css code.

Requirements fot html:
1.you must use doctype.
2.you must specify utf-8.
3.you should specify language.
4.you should specify meta-attribute content "edge", because "edge" is the latest version.
5.you should ude double quotes "" instead of single '' and  necessarily to put the class name in  double quotes "".
6.tag for closing </body> and </div> vas missed.
7.you should use (only)one tab for tags inside other tags.
8.</li> was missed and you should write <a>, which inside <li>, on the same one line for readable.
9.class should be first at line.
10.you should use </br> instead of <br>.
11.was in code: span class="avatar". Should be: div class="avatar". Because <img> inside <span> in not correct.
12.were renamed div class="footer"-> footer, some <div>s -> <section>  for semantic.

Requirements fot css:
1.you should make separated file for css code.
2.media queries should be in the end.
3.End all declarations should be with a semi-colon.
4.When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
5.keyframes is not used, so it is excess code (i have deleted it).
6.Some changing for colors:#33333-> #333 and #COLOR->#color.
7.you should use short entry for properties, for example:
     padding:40px 20px ;
instead of
    /*padding-left: 20px;*/
    /*padding-right: 20px;*/
    /*padding-top: 40px;:;*/
    /*padding-bottom: 40px;*/
or
    padding: 95px 0 70px 0;
instead of
    padding: 95px 0px 70px 0px;
or
    div.footer {
        padding-top: 50px;
    }
instead of
    div.footer {
        padding: 50px 0px 0px 0px;
    }
8.Some classes like "top-nav", "gray" , "logo", "item-nav" are not declared in css styles.
9.I join some classes with the same properties:
  .skills .skill-list,
  .third-block .award-list{
        margin-left: 0;// was repeated
   }
